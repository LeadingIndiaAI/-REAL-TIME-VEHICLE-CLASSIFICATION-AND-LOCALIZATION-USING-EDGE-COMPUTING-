# -REAL-TIME-VEHICLE-CLASSIFICATION-AND-LOCALIZATION-USING-EDGE-COMPUTING-
The project aims to develop a traffic monitoring system using convolution neural network. We had modified existing tiny YOLO model for Indian vehicle such as auto rickshaw, bicycle, motorbikes etc. To do this, first we developed a data set of these vehicles then we retrained the existing tiny YOLO model. Moreover, with raspberry Pi we have developed a prototype for edge device which can count incoming and outgoing traffic from a particular point. There are various applications of such devices for example, it can be used as traffic monitoring system, surveillance, traffic load prediction. This is a fully functional independent device. All the decision has been done locally, this make this device highly useful for IoTs.
